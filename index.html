		Hi, I'm Shayna.
		<br>
		I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley passionate about using technology to make a difference in the world.
		I've always loved math and science, and I'm extremely interested in both mechanical systems and software. My interests include social impact, the environment, urban technology, education, assistive technology, and neural interfaces, and I hope to eventually combine one of these with my knowledge to make a difference in the world.

			I love to create new things--I've been designing for as long as I can remember, from when I was eight years old and carried an "inventor's notebook" with me wherever I went to the projects I work on now. I love investigating things at the intersection of disciplines, whether that's art and computer science, biology and engineering, or environmental science and evolution. After all, the ideas that change the world are the interdisciplinary ones.

				As a part of the club EnableTech, I spent this semester working on the preliminary design for JARL: Just Another Robotic Limb. JARL is a wheelchair attachment for people with limited hand mobility, and our team hopes that we will eventually be able to put JARL on the market as a low-cost option for people to use. I specifically helped design the linear actuator that helps the arm move on the z-axis this semester.

				This is my personal project: I designed this website from scratch so that I could learn more HTML/CSS. Although I first learned the two while experimenting with web design in eighth grade, I had avoided web development since then because I thought it was really tedious. However, with the development of this website, I learned that I enjoy using HTML, CSS, and jQuery to design websites.

				As a part of my internship in the Payne Paleobiology Lab at Stanford during the summer of 2015, I used data on marine organisms and environmental factors to analyze the frequency of particular characteristics in each genera and phyla over epochs of time. I used R and statistical analysis to determine the environmentâ€™s effects on diversity, and I presented my project at American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2015.

				As a part of the Women's Technology Program in Mechanical Engineering at MIT, a partner and I modeled the energy usage of a skyscraper to design the renewable energy systems for a net-zero energy skyscraper that pays back its energy costs in six years using solar panels, wind energy, and waste-to-fuel systems. Presented project at American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2016.

				As an extra credit project for my AP Computer Science class senior year of high school, I designed a paint program using Java Graphics and the drawing interface my textbook provided. Although I spent all of winter break working on it and learning how to use user interaction in Java, it was a fun project that taught me how to use my computer science skills in the real world.
