		Hi, I'm Shayna.
		<br>
		I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley passionate about using technology to make a difference in the world.
		I've always loved math and science, and I'm extremely interested in both mechanical systems and software. My interests include social impact, the environment, urban technology, education, assistive technology, and neural interfaces, and I hope to eventually combine one of these with my knowledge to make a difference in the world.

			I love to create new things--I've been designing for as long as I can remember, from when I was eight years old and carried an "inventor's notebook" with me wherever I went to the projects I work on now. I love investigating things at the intersection of disciplines, whether that's art and computer science, biology and engineering, or environmental science and evolution. After all, the ideas that change the world are the interdisciplinary ones.
