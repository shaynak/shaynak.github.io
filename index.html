                    I'm currently a software engineer at Facebook, where I work on ads transparency.

                    I recently graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied 
                    Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Human Rights. In my time at Berkeley, I was lucky enough to be named a Regents' and

                students across the country. I volunteer remotely at the <a href = "https://www.allaccelerated.org/">Accelerated Learning Laboratory</a>'s Green Fields campus in Tuscon, Arizona,
                helping cover material from the <a href = "https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU CS Academy</a> curriculum.

                I was also involved in teaching computer science for all four years of my time at UC Berkeley. I've been on staff for two courses, <a href = "https://cs61a.org">CS 61A</a>, 
                our introductory computer science course, a fast-paced introduction to Python, Scheme, and SQL, and <a href = "https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs370">CS 370</a>, a course 
                focused on teaching pedagogy to aspiring undergraduate and graduate student instructors.
