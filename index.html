                    Hi! I'm Shayna.

                <p class = "inner-text">
                    I'm a software engineer at Facebook, where I work on the <a href="https://facebook.com/ads/library">Ad Library</a>, among other things. 
                    I'm passionate about digital inclusion, social justice, the environment, and much more.

                    In 2020, I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I studied 
                    Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Human Rights. In my time at Berkeley, I was lucky enough to be named a Regents' and 
                    Chancellor's Scholar, a <a href = "https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2019/07/berkeley-students-get-a-global-perspective-of-technology-innovation/">
