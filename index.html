                    Hi! I'm Shayna.
                </p>
                <p class = "inner-text"></p>
                    I'm currently a senior at UC Berkeley, where I study 
                    Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Human Rights.
                    I'm an engineer and writer passionate about social justice,
                    education, and the environment.
                </p>
                <p class = "inner-text"></p>
                    In my time at Berkeley, I've been lucky enough to be named a Regents' and 
                    Chancellor's Scholar, a <a href = "https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2019/07/berkeley-students-get-a-global-perspective-of-technology-innovation/">
                    GLOBE Ambassador</a>, a <a href = "https://bigideascontest.org/projects/opportunity-through-data/">Big Ideas Competition winner</a>, and <a href = "https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/news/introducing-fall-2018-innovation-catalysts-grant-winners/">a Jacobs Innovation Catalyst Grant awardee</a>.

                    In my free time, you might find me playing my ukulele, writing poetry, or 
                    hiking around the Bay Area!

                I've been involved in teaching computer science at UC Berkeley since my freshman year. I've been on staff for two courses, <a href = "https://cs61a.org">CS 61A</a>, 
                our introductory computer science course, a fast-paced introduction to Python, Scheme, and SQL, and <a href = "https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs370">CS 370</a>, a course 
                focused on teaching pedagogy to aspiring undergraduate and graduate student instructors.
