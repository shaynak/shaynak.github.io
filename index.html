		Hi, I'm Shayna.
		<br>
		I'm a freshman at UC Berkeley passionate about using technology to make a difference in the world.
		I've always loved math and science, and I'm extremely interested in both mechanical systems and software. My interests include social impact, the environment, urban technology, education, assistive technology, and neural interfaces, and I hope to eventually combine one of these with my knowledge to make a difference in the world.

				we used machine learning algorithms on the most recent real-time stock data, testing models ranging from complex recurrent neural networks and SVRs to basic linear regression. ultimately, we optimized exponential moving averages to use multiple-length windows concurrently, drawing insights on whether the stock will perform better or worse in the next time step based on their crossover ratio.

		When I'm not building things, you can find me <a href = "http://medium.com/@shaynak" style ="color: darkslategray">writing poetry, short stories, and opinion pieces</a>; reading everything from Neil Gaiman and Ta-Nehisi Coates to <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Nature</i>; exploring nature; and learning more about the way the world works. On campus, I'm a part of Berkeley Model United Nations and EnableTech, clubs that fuel my desire to make social change through education and creation.<br><br>
		Some things I'm currently up to:
		<li>Working on a project, <i>Opportunity Through Data</i>, for the <a href = "http://bigideas.berkeley.edu">Big Ideas Competition</a>--my team was selected as finalists for our idea to provide data science education in prisons</li>
		<li>Vice chairing UN-Habitat for Berkeley Model United Nations, a high school Model UN conference held in March every year</li>
		<li>Trying to write more (and creating a portfolio for my writing, which you can see <a href = "http://shaynak.github.io/writing">here</a>)</li>
